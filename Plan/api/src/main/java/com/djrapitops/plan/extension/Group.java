 * Method parameter for providing values about a group with provider annotations.

 * Usage Example: {@code @StringProvider String provideStringAboutGroup(Group group)}
 * <p>
 * Group names of users are provided with {@code @GroupProvider String[] provideGroups(UUID playerUUID)}
 * {@code Group} parameter methods are not called without knowledge of a group name.
 * <p>
 * This method parameter is used since it is not possible to differentiate String playerName and String groupName.
